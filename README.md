## Contributing

We are open to any contributions that would help enhance the project in terms of new features, visual appeal and more interactivity.

To get the website running, first you have to configure MySQL Workbench by connecting to MySQL Server and creating host, root and password. When you configure MySQL make sure to remember your credentials for host, root and password. Open MySQLWorkbench and execute the database phillyTravelDatabase.sql. To run the script, click on the lightning bolt icon (Execute) or press Ctrl + Shift + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + Enter (Mac). After running the script, check the Action Output pane at the bottom to see if the script executed successfully. Verify the Database: In the left sidebar, under the SCHEMAS section, you should see the newly created database and its tables. Expand the database and tables to verify that everything has been created as expected.

Now open test_database.py and put your own host, root and password under 'db = mysql.connector.connect'. Run test_database.py and now you can open the website and browse.
